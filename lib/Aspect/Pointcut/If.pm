=head1 NAME

Aspect::Pointcut::If - Pointcut that allows arbitrary Perl code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Aspect;
  
  # High-level creation
  my $pointcut1 = if_true { rand() > 0.5 };
  
  # Manual creation
  my $pointcut2 = Aspect::Pointcut::If->new(
    sub { rand() > 0.5 }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Because L<Aspect>'s weaving phase technically occurs at run-time (relative
to the overall process) it does not need to be limit itself only to 
conditions that are fully describable at compile-time.

B<Aspect::Pointcut::If> allows you to take advantage of this to create your
own custom run-time pointcut conditions, although for safety and purity
reasons you are not permitted to create custom conditions that interact
with the L<Aspect::Point> object for the call.
