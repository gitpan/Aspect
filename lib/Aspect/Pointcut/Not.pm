=head1 NAME

Aspect::Pointcut::Not - Logical 'not' pointcut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Aspect;
  
  # High-level creation
  my $pointcut1 = ! call 'one';
  
  # Manual creation
  my $pointcut2 = Aspect::Pointcut::Not->new(
      Aspect::Pointcut::Call->new('one')
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Aspect::Pointcut::Not> is a logical condition, which is used
to create higher-order conditions from smaller parts.

It takes two or more conditions, and applies appropriate logic during the
various calculations that produces a logical set-wise 'and' result.
