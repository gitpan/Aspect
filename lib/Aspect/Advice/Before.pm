=head1 NAME

Aspect::Advice::Before - Execute code before a function is called

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Aspect;
  
  before {
  
      # Trace all calls to your module
      print STDERR "Called my function " . $_->sub_name . "\n";
  
      # Shortcut calls to foo() to always be true
      if ( $_->short_name eq 'foo' ) {
          return $_->return_value(1);
      }
  
      # Add an extra flag to bar() but call as normal
      if ( $_->short_name eq 'bar' ) {
          $_->args( $_->args, 'flag' );
      }

  } call qr/^ MyModule::\w+ $/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<before> advice type is used to execute advice code prior to entry
into a target function. It is implemented by B<Aspect::Advice::Before>.

As well as creating side effects that run before the main code, the
C<before> advice type is particularly useful for changing parameters or
shortcutting calls to functions entirely and replacing the value they
would normally return with a different value.

Please note that the C<highest> pointcut (L<Aspect::Pointcut::Highest>) is
incompatible with C<before>. Creating a C<before> advice with a pointcut
tree that contains a C<highest> pointcut will result in an exception.

If speed is important to your program then C<before> is particular
interesting as the C<before> implementation is the only one that can take
advantage of tail calls via Perl's C<goto> function, where the rest of the
advice types need the more costly L<Sub::Uplevel> to keep caller() returning
correctly.
