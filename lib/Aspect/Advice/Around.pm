=head1 NAME

Aspect::Advice::Around - Execute code both before and after a function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Aspect;
  
  around {
      # Trace all calls to your module
      print STDERR "Called my function " . $_->sub_name . "\n";
  
      # Lexically alter a global for this function
      local $MyModule::MAXSIZE = 1000;
  
      # Continue and execute the function
      $_->run_original;
  
      # Suppress exceptions for the call
      $_->return_value(1) if $_->exception;
  
  } call qr/^ MyModule::\w+ $/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<around> advice type is used to execute code on either side of a
function, allowing deep and precise control of how the function will be
called when none of the other advice types are good enough.

Using C<around> advice is also critical if you want to lexically alter
the environment in which the call will be made (as in the example above
where a global variable is temporarily changed).

This advice type is also the most computationally expensive to run, so if
your problem can be solved with the use of a different advice type,
particularly C<before>, you should use that instead.

Please note that unlike the other advice types, your code in C<around> is
required to trigger the execution of the target function yourself with the
C<proceed> method. If you do not C<proceed> and also do not set either a
C<return_value> or C<exception>, the function call will return C<undef>
in scalar context or the null list C<()> in list context.
