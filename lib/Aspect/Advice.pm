=head1 NAME

Aspect::Advice - Change how Perl code is run at a pointcut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # creating using public interface: trace calls to Account subs
  use Aspect;
  before { print 'called: '. shift->sub_name } call qw/^Account::/;

  # creating using internal interface
  use Aspect::Advice;
  $advice = Aspect::Advice->new(before =>
     { print 'called: '. shift->sub_name },
     call qw/^Account::/
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An advice is composed of a pointcut and some code that will run at the
pointcut. The code is run C<before> or C<after> the pointcut, depending
on advice C<type>.

You do not normally create advice using the constructor. By C<use()>ing
L<Aspect|::Aspect>, you get 2 subs imported: C<before()> and C<after()>,
that do what you need. They also store the advice if called in void
context, so you do not need to keep in scope. The advice code will be
removed when the advice object is destroyed.

The advice code is given one parameter: an L<Aspect::AdviceContext>. You
use this object to change the parameter list for the matched sub, modify
return value, find out information about the matched sub, and more.

This class has no public methods that do anything, but there are
accessors C<weaver()>, C<type()>, C<code()>, and C<pointcut()>, if you
need them.
