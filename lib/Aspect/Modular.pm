=head1 NAME

Aspect::Modular - First generation base class for reusable aspects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Subclassing to create a reusable aspect
  package Aspect::Library::ConstructorTracer;
  
  use strict;
  use base 'Aspect::Modular';
  use Aspect::Advice::After ();
  
  sub get_advice {
     my $self     = shift;
     my $pointcut = shift;
     return Aspect::Advice::After->new(
         lexical  => $self->lexical,
         pointcut => $pointcut,
         code     => sub {
             print 'Created object: ' . shift->return_value . "\n";
         },
     );
  }

  # Using the new aspect
  package main;
  
  use Aspect;
  
  # Print message when constructing new Person
  aspect ConstructorTracer => call 'Person::new';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All reusable aspect inherit from this class.

Such aspects are created in user code, using the C<aspect()> sub exported
by L<Aspect|::Aspect>. You call C<aspect()> with the class name of the
reusable aspect (it must exist in the package C<Aspect::Library>), and any
parameters (pointcuts, class names, code to run, etc.) the specific aspect
may require.

The L<Wormhole|Aspect::Library::Wormhole> aspect, for example, expects 2
pointcut specs for the wormhole source and target, while the
L<Profiler|Aspect::Library::Profiler> aspect expects a pointcut object,
to select the subs to be profiled.

You create a reusable aspect by subclassing this class, and providing one
I<template method>: C<get_advice()>. It is called with all the parameters
that were sent when user code created the aspect, and is expected to
return L<Aspect::Advice> object/s, that will be installed while the
reusable aspect is still in scope. If the C<aspect()> sub is called in
void context, the reusable aspect is installed until class reloading or
interpreter shutdown.

Typical things a reusable aspect may want to do:

=over 4

=item *

Install advice on pointcuts specified by the caller

=item *

Push (vs. OOP pull) subs and base classes into classes specified by
the caller
