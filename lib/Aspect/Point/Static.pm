=head1 NAME

Aspect::Point::Static - The Join Point context for join point static parts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the "static part" join point object, normally
encounted during (and stored by) the C<cflow> pointcut declarator.

It implements the subset of L<Aspect::Point> methods relating to the join
point in general and not relating to the specific call to the join point.
