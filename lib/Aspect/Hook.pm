=head1 NAME

Aspect::Hook - Holding area for internal generated code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

During the weaving process L<Aspect> needs do a large amount of code
generation and it is important that this generated code is kept away from
the target packages to prevent accidental collisions and other pollution.

To prevent this, all of the generated code is produced in a dedicated and
isolated namespace.

B<Aspect::Hook> is the namespace in which this happens. Beyond this purpose,
this class services no other purpose.
